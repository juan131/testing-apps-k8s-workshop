# Exercise 03 - Testing your apps in production

# Test 1: Checking page loads on production

Create a test that checks that the page loads as expected. This test just checks that the main page loads and that the expected message as well as the login link appears. For running the tests, create a kubernetes cronjob that periodically runs the test on the production environment.
